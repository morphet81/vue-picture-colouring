# Vue Picture Colouring

This is a library intenteded for coloring and stick stickers on pictures. When you color parts of your image that are transparent, the transparency information is kept so that you can colourize objects without going beyond their limits. Also works fot the stickers: if you try to put a sticker in a transparent area, it will not appear.

For now, it's made for mobile only.
